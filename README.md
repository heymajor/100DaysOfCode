# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 26, 2019

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Successfully created repos for a staging and live site that are synced with local repos.

**Thoughts:** Reinstalled VScode because of an odd glitch where it uninstalls itself when it decides to update [when you shutdown Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/52855) and am still having authentication issues when commiting changes. I need to configure gpg-agent to play nice, but at least I completed the [self-prescribed goal due the day before](https://twitter.com/MajorByDesign/status/1198068070876667906). It's not a live yet, but the foundation is there.

### Day 1: November 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tears. Minimal progress.

**Thoughts**: GPG is a great thing to learn, but it's not ideal to tackle while using Windows 10 and WSL. I've got it working okay (Imported key generated on keybase to my system/added subkeys for SSH and Yubikey/Explored how to edit key), but I need to do another dance around how Windows and WSL handle USB drivers without offending Yubikey.

### Day 2: Thursday, December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reconfigured global git settings to not sign commits. Successfully synced this repo and site and site_staging repos that I had hoped to sync. Set up custom snippets to help with the 100 Days Of Code logging. Identified JS fundamentals to learn: DOM / JSON / Fetch API/ Modern JS (ES6). Identified basic deployment steps: domain registration / managed hosting / static hosting / SSL certificate (and methods/tools: FTP, SFTP / SSH / CLI & Git)

**Thoughts**: I explored GPG keys a bit further but decided to not sign commits with a key until I'm more comfortable configuring and using them with Windows. My keybase history shows me deleting keys and creating keys left and right because I didn't know you could add/remove keys once they were created - much less adjust permissions and expirations.

This is the kind of stuff that really gets me excited, but it's also a rabbit hole that would have me running in place for a few more days and I still don't really have a grand goal for this 100 Days of Code project. Sure, I can continue to customize and set up a coding environment and post blogs about how I use my dotfiles and extensions. I can even walk through the custom functions that I'm using to do what isn't currently contributing to the forward momentum to my progress as a developer. That's not true - how they came to be and that they exist might be interesting.

Maybe another part of this is the lack of self confidence that has prevented me from publicly submitting myself or my projects in fear of the criticism or anticipation of what feels like a hint of something you've experienced before (and never want to again). If you're reading this, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

All of our days are numbered; we won't live forever. No matter how much we wish for that to not apply to our pets, it still does. My dog being sick and needing extra care is definitely messing with my head. Not intending to sound callous (or even getting this deep in a fucking log message), but maybe it would help to know what his number of days is. Maybe it wouldn't. Treating each day as if it was his last gets exhausting, but I can't stand the idea of relaxing on a day, and _that_ day ends up being his last. Anyway, he's rather warm and is comfortably passed out at the moment. He's good. I'm good. You're good :)

I need a better web presence and ultimately want to implement website designs using JS/CSS/HTML instead of allowing the design being limited by the limitations of the theme provided. Here are my goals for 100 Days Of Code:

1. Build a consultation website up and out with Gatsby. We'll have or address the 4 core pages: Landing/Blog/About/Contact and expand with Services and a newsletter with a GDPR Privacy Policy page.
2. Build a test site with Gatsby with Wordpress as the headless CMS
3. Develop my own Wordpress theme

Misc goals:

- Update dotfiles repo and verify
-

There could be 1000 other steps for each goal, but I'm also trying to use this as a way to test what I know and don't know. I don't know a lot, and I won't know what I do know until I figure a few things out.

### Day 4: Monday, December 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Stuck in a rut and bogged down with so much info about React and GraphQL after walking through the
@gatsbyjs
tutorial - and then again when walking through the React tic-tac-toe tutorial.

Very literally a whole new world.

..but it feels like too much too soon. There must be a better way for me to learn this.

Surprisingly down on myself.

Excitement about something + inability to do the thing is frustrating and debilitating.

Playing 'Kind Words' from
@popcannibal
helped to restore my faith in myself and others :)

Helping people helps. People being nice to you helps. Being nice to people helps.

### Day 5: Monday, December 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stumbled onto @rwieruch's 'The Road to Learn React' -might be what I've been looking for.

I'll be working through this for the time being :)

### Day 6: Monday, December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I feel like I'm asking too many basic JS questions while I'm looking at React, so I'm turning to vanilla Javascript. Looking at #LearnJavascriptTheHardWay, an Udemy course, and #Javascript30

### Day 7: Monday, December 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Next few days about vanilla JS are going to be.. well.. vanilla. Fundamentals aren't fun.

Today, I reviewed how to display variables in a string and explored examples using arguments declared from the command line.

**Today's Progress**: How to work with requirements, use content from files as args, and explore nodejs API for what dreams are made of.

### Day 9: Monday, December 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went a bit deeper today and explored different ways to use callback functions and used conditional statements in a function, sequences, different ways to write out functions, and labels.

Labels remind me of Exapunks

### Day 10: Monday, December 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I explored different ways to define and work with arrays and different examples of how to call arrays (and nested components). Had Prince stuck in my head for the rest of the afternoon.

### Day 11: Monday, December 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Using conditional statements with a series of functions, created a basic, 3-room Zork-like game. Had some issues nesting functions, but I might be making it more complex than necessary. Also explored debugging in VScode.

### Day 12: Monday, December 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Walked through the drum kit and CSS + JS clock (D1 and D2) and am looking at Day 3. My goal is to walk through the day's scope without video instruction. Saying I 'did' the projects feels like being proud of a paint-by-numbers atm
