# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 26, 2019 
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Successfully created repos for a staging and live site that are synced with local repos. 

**Thoughts:** Reinstalled VScode because of an odd glitch where it uninstalls itself when it decides to update [when you shutdown Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/52855) and am still having authentication issues when commiting changes. I need to configure gpg-agent to play nice, but at least I completed the [self-prescribed goal due the day before](https://twitter.com/MajorByDesign/status/1198068070876667906). It's not a live yet, but the foundation is there.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
